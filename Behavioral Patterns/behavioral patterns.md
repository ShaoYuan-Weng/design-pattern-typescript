# Behavioral Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns are about communications between objects

- #### [command](command.ts)
facilitates the creation of the object whose constructor has lots of parameters

- #### [strategy](strategy.ts)
selects the algorithms on runtime

- #### [state](state.ts)
allows object to change behavior when then internal state changes 

- #### [chain of responsibility](chain_of_responsibility.ts)
creates a series of processing objects to get the chance to handle the incoming request
