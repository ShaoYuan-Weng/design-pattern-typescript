# Structural Patterns

### Structural Patterns aim to form a simple structure of different classes.

- #### [adapter](adapter.ts)
forms a simple interface to talk to third-party services

- #### [bridge](bridge.ts)
decouples abstractions and implementations

- #### [composite](composite.ts)
treats a collection of items as item itself

- #### [decorator](decorator.ts)
adds new functionalities at runtime

- #### [facade](facade.ts)
provides a simple interface to client
